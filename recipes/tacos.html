    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These ranch chicken tacos are a great change from regular Mexican-style tacos. A quick, cool summer dinner made with leftover rotisserie chicken. Naturally, you can use any type of chicken cooked the way you like; just be sure to shred it for real tacos.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup malt vinegar</li>
        <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mixed spice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a glass baking dish, mix together the malt vinegar, 1/4 cup yogurt, vegetable oil, mixed spice, cardamom, salt and pepper. Place the chicken thighs into the mixture and turn to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, mix together the tahini, 1/4 cup yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper, taste, and adjust flavors if desired. Cover and refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Cover the chicken and bake in the marinade for 30 minutes, turning once. Uncover, and cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until chicken is browned and cooked through. Remove from the dish, and cut into slices.</li>
        
    </ol>
